# Repository Topology Migration Planning Package

**Status:** 🟡 **PLANNING ONLY - NOT EXECUTED**  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 30, 2026  
**Author:** Manus AI  
**Authority:** Pending Founder Ratification

## Overview

This directory contains the complete planning package for migrating the WebWaka platform from its temporary single-repository topology (INV-012) to a permanent multi-repository architecture. This migration was formally initiated by the Founder on January 30, 2026, following the successful completion of Wave 3.

**This is a planning-only package. No execution has occurred. Execution requires explicit Founder approval.**

## Key Deliverables

This planning package fulfills all mandatory deliverables specified in the Founder's initiation request:

- [x] **Repository Topology Migration Plan** - Main planning document
- [x] **Governance Impact & Invariant Mapping** - Explicit invariant preservation analysis
- [x] **Migration Phases & Timeline** - Phased migration strategy with timeline
- [x] **Risk & Mitigation Analysis** - Comprehensive risk assessment
- [x] **Founder Decision Brief** - Decision-grade summary

## Founder Decisions Required

To proceed with execution, the Founder must explicitly approve:

1. **Approve Migration** - Proceed with the multi-repository topology migration
2. **Retire INV-012** - Formally retire the temporary single-repository invariant
3. **Ratify INV-012v2** - Ratify the new multi-repository topology invariant
4. **Approve Timeline** - Approve the 4-6 week phased migration timeline
5. **Assign Executor** - Assign Manus (or another agent) to execute the migration

---

## Next Steps

Upon Founder approval:

1. A new planning item will be added to the Master Control Board
2. A formal execution prompt will be created for Phase 1 (Governance Repository Creation)
3. The migration will proceed through the six phases with approval gates between each phase
4. A final verification report will be created upon migration completion

---

## Governance Compliance

This planning package complies with:

- **INV-011 (PaA Execution):** All work traceable to this planning package
- **INV-012 (Single-Repository Topology):** All planning documents committed to the current repository
- **Master Control Board Supremacy:** This planning package will be tracked in the MCB upon Founder approval
